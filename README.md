# Wiki-CLI

I'm lazy, I know that.

Sometimes I'm so lazy, that I don't even want to leave my terminal.

So, I wrote a small Wiki fetcher - whenever I need to know something fast, I can just use this package.

## How-To

* `git clone`

* `go build`

Or - forget these two steps and just use the binary in the repo and

* Run the file with string which you want to wiki: `./wiki "tom morello"`

The result is the small summary of the question.

## What to do next?

Well, probably, I need to check if there's any redirects and maybe do some help when you Wiki some badly written stuff.

I'm actually super stoked about this app!

**IDEA:** Use as proper, nice **CLI** - type whatever you need, then ask the user to show either result in the terminal or in a new VIM session.
