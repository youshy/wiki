# Wiki-CLI

I'm lazy, I know that.

Sometimes I'm so lazy, that I don't even want to leave my terminal.

So, I wrote a small Wiki fetcher - whenever I need to know something fast, I can just use this package.

## How-To

* `git clone`

* `go build`

* Run the file with string which you want to wiki: `./wiki "tom morello"`

## What to do next?

Definitely it needs a lot of TLC. There's a lot of things wrong here but - I'll get there!
